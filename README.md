# Pasic Editor
Pasic editor is a bare-bone game engine that was a more data orientated project of mine. That focuses more on how to handle data (mainly entities and their components at the time being) without making your computer go *boom*. It uses WPF C# for the UI and C++ for the actual engine with a DLL to tie them together. Currently the game engine is non operational because it is still just a skeleton but there is a stress tester that I have made to test how many entities it can handle. It basically shoves a random bunch of entities into the game engine while also removing a random amount. And then repeat till it gives an error.

This project has taught me a lot about how game engines work behind the scences and also how to make applications using WPF.

If you do end up downloading it. Be sure to change some of the code because I'm pretty sure I had some paths hard coded but Im unsure if I've already fixed it.
